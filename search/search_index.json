Proxy A server acting as an intermediary to route your web requests, masking your original IP address. WebRTC A technology that enables real-time peer-to-peer audio and video communication directly from your browser. Fingerprinting Techniques used to uniquely identify and track users based on browser configurations and behaviors. Cookies Small data files stored by your browser that retain user preferences, sessions, and other information. User Agent A browser string identifying the browser type, version, operating system, and rendering engine used. Browser Fingerprinting Identifying users uniquely based on their browser and system characteristics, such as installed fonts, screen resolution, or plugins. IP Address An Internet Protocol address used to identify and communicate with devices over a network. IP Bans Restrictions placed on specific IP addresses, preventing them from accessing a website or service, often used to block unwanted traffic or abuse. Web Scraping The automated process of extracting data from websites using bots or scripts, often used for data collection, analysis, or competitive monitoring. Digital Identity The online representation of a user, formed by data such as IP address, browser fingerprint, cookies, and behavioral patterns that websites use to recognize and track individuals. Proxy Provider A service or company that supplies access to proxy servers, allowing users to mask their real IP addresses and manage multiple online identities. Rotating Proxies A proxy setup where the IP address automatically changes at intervals or per request, enhancing anonymity and reducing the chance of IP bans during tasks like web scraping. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) A protocol used for transmitting data between a browser and a website. HTTP proxies can only handle web traffic and do not support non-browser apps or encrypted connections as robustly as others SOCKS4 A proxy protocol that routes network packets between a client and server through a proxy server, supporting only TCP connections and lacking authentication or encryption. SOCKS5 An advanced proxy protocol that supports both TCP and UDP traffic, authentication, and better security, making it suitable for a wider range of applications including P2P and email. Port A virtual access point used for sending and receiving data on a device, often associated with a specific service or protocol on the internet. Port Number A numerical identifier (ranging from 0 to 65535) assigned to specific processes or services on a networked device to manage different types of data traffic. Uniqueness A measure of how distinguishable a user's browser or digital fingerprint is from others online; higher uniqueness increases the chance of being tracked or identified."},{"location":"profile/","title":"Profile Setup","text":""},{"location":"profile/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Incogniton\u2019s anti-detect browser lets you create profiles to manage your online identities securely.
