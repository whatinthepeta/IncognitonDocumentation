| HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) | A protocol used for transmitting data between a browser and a website. HTTP proxies can only handle web traffic and do not support non-browser apps or encrypted connections as robustly as others |
| SOCKS4                             | A proxy protocol that routes network packets between a client and server through a proxy server, supporting only TCP connections and lacking authentication or encryption.                         |
| SOCKS5                             | An advanced proxy protocol that supports both TCP and UDP traffic, authentication, and better security, making it suitable for a wider range of applications including P2P and email.              |
| Port                               | A virtual access point used for sending and receiving data on a device, often associated with a specific service or protocol on the internet.                                                      |

| Uniqueness                         | A measure of how distinguishable a user's browser or digital fingerprint is from others online; higher uniqueness increases the chance of being tracked or identified.                             |
