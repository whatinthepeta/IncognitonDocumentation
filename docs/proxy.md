# Proxy Management

## Overview

Incogniton's anti-detect browser offers powerful proxy management capabilities that can be challenging to navigate for new users. This guide walks you through the optimal configuration and organization of your proxies to create a seamless setup that remains clear and manageable as your proxy and profile usage grows. For this tutorial, make sure you have navigated over to the "Proxy Management" tab on the left hand side of the home screen.


## Before Setting up your Proxies
Creating a group for your proxies

From inside the Proxy Management tab,
Click on the "Groups" option in the left sidebar →
Click the "New Group" button in the top right corner of the screen →
Give your group a descriptive name that reflects its purpose (e.g., "US Location" "Facebook Accounts" "Windows OS").
Organizing your proxies into logical groups makes managing multiple profiles with different proxies much easier.

### 2. Naming Your Proxy

Type a clear naming convention for your proxy to make it easier for you to distinguish between multiple proxies when your collection grows. While you can use any naming system, we recommend including key identifying information such as: location, associated profile, and/or operating system.

### 4. Add the Port Number
    
After entering your proxy IP address with the colon, add the port number directly after it without any spaces. Your completed entry should look like "123.45.67.89:8080" where 8080 is the port number provided by your proxy service.

If you have purchased a rotating proxy that automatically changes locations: Check the "Rotating Proxy" box in the configuration panel.
